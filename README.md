# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting visualizer is a web application that provides an interactive visual representation of sorting algorithms. It typically consists of three main components:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for defining the structure and content of the web page.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling the appearance of the web page.

JavaScript for implementing the sorting algorithms and providing interactivity to the visualizer.

The HTML provides the framework for displaying the elements that make up the visualizer, such as the data array, the bars, and the control buttons. The CSS is used to style the elements, such as setting their colors, fonts, and dimensions.

The JavaScript code is responsible for the sorting algorithms, and it animates the sorting process by manipulating the styles of the HTML elements in real-time. It also handles user interactions, such as starting and stopping the sorting, and adjusting the speed of the animation.
